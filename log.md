### Day 2: February 26, Saturday
##### Objective : Completing FrontEnd mentor advice card challenge

**Today's Progress**:
* Learnt how to use fetch in javascript.
* Had a problem with API's caching time (2 seconds).
* Solved by accessing the advice itself (by adding a random number to URL) without waiting for cache to restart.
* Learnt new notions : Asynchronous programming, async/await, 

**Thoughts** Working with API is really awesome. So many fun stuff to do with them.
